# Java Repo - All things Java!

## What is this for?

#### This is for me and anyone else who wants to learn and tinker with Java!  I am making one project/repo that will house all of my random Java time.  This also includes learning from Udemy courses and random things I see on the internet or late night random coding ideas

Also, I do want to make sure that if I do any online course that I give credit where credit is due. 

#### Things I found on Internet to try and code

#### Udemy Courses
* Java Programming Masterclass updated to Java 17 - https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/


#### YouTube


#### Website
* For the random code bit - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8878015/return-true-or-false-randomly#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20the%20following%20for%20an%20unbiased%20result%3A,(2)%20%3D%3D%200)%20%3F
