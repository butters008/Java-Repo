# Java Repo - All things Java!

## What is this for?

#### This is for me and anyone else who wants to learn and tinker with Java!  I am making one project/repo that will house all of my random Java time.  This also includes learning from Udemy courses and random things I see on the internet or late night random coding ideas

Also, I do want to make sure that if I do any online course that I give credit where credit is due. 

#### Things I found on Internet to try and code

#### Udemy Courses
