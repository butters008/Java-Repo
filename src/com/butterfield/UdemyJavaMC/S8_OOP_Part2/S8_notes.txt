Composition
- Inheritance defines an IS A relationship
- Composition defines a HAS A relationship
- Composition = is a way to make the combination of classes act like a single coherent object
- SIDE NOTES
    - I am pretty sure there is a lot of composition being used in my work and I think in Unity and LibGDX as well.
        - Pretty cool huh
- Creating objects within objects
- General rule, you probably want to use composition first
- We used both here
- All of our parts were able to inherit a set of attributes, like manufacturer and model
- The calling code did not have to know anything about these parts, to get driver (Composition_BuildIt_Example.java) to do something
Reason composition is preferred over inheritance
    - Is more flexible, you can add, remove, and change are less likely to have a downstream effect
    - Provides functional reuse outside of the class hierarchy, meaning classes can share attributes & behavior, by having similar components,
    instead of inheriting functionality from a parent or base class
    - Java's inheritance breaks encapsulation, becuase subclasses may need direct access to a parent's state or behavior
Why is inheritance less flexible
    - is less flexible
    - Adding a class to or removing a class from a class hierarchy may impact all subclasses from that point
    - In addition, a new subclass may not need all the functionality or attributes of its parent clas

Encapsulation
- To make the interface simpler, we may want to hide unnecessary details (not the interface type)
- To protect the integrity of data on an object, we may hide or restrict access to some data and operations
- To decouple the published interface from the internal details of the class, we may hide actual names and types of class members
- Problems of NOT encapsulating
    - Allows direct access to data on an object, can bypass checks and operations
    - It encourages an interdependency, or coupling, between the calling code and the class
        - Makes it hard, if you change the class, it will break the calling code
- Benefits of USING encapsulation
    - You're not affecting any other code
    - We protect; fields, members, and some methods of the class, from external access
    - prevents calling code from bypassing the rules and constraints we've built in
    - When we create a new object, its initialized with valid data
